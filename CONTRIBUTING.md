# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to
follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer)
retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Pull Request Etiquette

We're thrilled to have your pull request! However, we ask that you file an issue (or check if one exist) before
submitting a change-list (CL).

In general, we're happier reviewing many small PRs over fewer, larger changes. Please try to
submit [small CLs](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html).

## Developer Installation

1. Set up a Python development environment with *Anaconda* or
   [*Miniconda*](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

    * On a Mac, you can run `brew install miniconda`.

    * Use Python version 3.8.5+ for development. We have not yet upgraded the project to use Python 3.9
      (see [#166](https://github.com/google/weather-tools/issues/166)).

3. Clone the repo and install dependencies with anaconda.

   ```shell
   # clone with HTTPS
   git clone http://github.com/google/weather-tools.git
   # clone with SSH
   git clone git@github.com:google/weather-tools.git
   cd weather-tools
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate weather-tools
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. Install `gcloud`, the Google Cloud CLI, following these [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

5. Acquire adequate permissions for the project.
    * Run `gcloud auth application-default login`.

    * Make sure your account has *write* permissions to the storage bucket as well as the permissions to create a
      Dataflow job.

    * Make sure that both Dataflow and Cloud Storage are enabled on your Google Cloud Platform project.

### Windows Developer Instructions

Windows support for each CLI is currently under development (
See [#64](https://github.com/google/weather-tools/issues/64)). However, there are workarounds available for running the
nweather tools outside of installation with `pip`.

First, the would-be pip-installed script can be run directly with python like so:

```shell
python weather_dl/weather-dl --help
```

## Testing

For testing at development time, we make use of three tools:

* `pytype` for checking types:
   ```shell
   # check everything
   pytype
   # check a specific tool
   pytype weather_dl
   ```

* `flake8` for linting:
   ```shell 
   # lint everything
   flake8
   # lint a specific tool
   flake8 weather_mv
   ```

* `pytest` for running tests:
   ```shell
   # test everything 
   pytest
   # test a specific tool
   pytest weather_sp
   ```

If you'd like to automate running these checks, we provide a post-push git hook:

```shell
cp bin/post-push .git/hooks/
```

This script can be run manually, too.

If you'd like to locally run these checks for all versions of python this project supports, you can use
`tox`. Tox will make use of the python versions installed on your machine and create virtual test environments on your
behalf.

```shell
tox
```

In addition, we provide a simple script to install _other_ branches locally. Run `bin/install-branch <branch-name>` to
pip install that branches working copy of weather-tools. Hopefully, this script facilitates testing of work-in-progress
contributions.

Please review the [Beam testing docs](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/pipelines/test-your-pipeline/) for guidance
in how to write tests for the pipeline.

## Documentation

Documents are generated with Sphinx and the myst-parser. To generate the documents locally, simply invoke `make`:

```shell
cd docs
rm -r _build
make html
```

> Note: Due to the idiosyncrasies of how Sphinx detects updates and our use of symbolic links, we recommend deleting the
> `_build` folder.

Or, you can run the following subshell command to re-generate everything without having to leave the project root:

```shell
(cd docs && rm -r _build && make html)
```

After the docs are re-generated, you can view them by starting a local file server, for example:

```shell
python -m http.server -d docs/_build/html
```

## Versions & Releasing

We aim to represent the version of each tool using [semver.org](https://semver.org/) semantic versions. To that end, we
will abide by the following pattern:

- When making a change to a particular tool, please remember to update its semantic version in the `setup.py` file.
- The version for _all the tools_ should be incremented on update to _any_ tool. If one tool changes, the
  whole `google-weather-tools` package should have its version incremented.
- The representation for the version of all of `google-weather-tools` is
  via [git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). To update the version of the package, please make
  an annotated tag with a short description of the change.
- When it's time for release, choose the latest tag and fill out the release description. Check out previous release
  notes to get an idea of how to structure the next one. These release notes are the primary changelog for the project.
