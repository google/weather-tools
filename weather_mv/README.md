# ⛅️ `weather-mv` – Weather Mover <sub><sup>_(alpha)_</sup></sub>

Weather Mover provides an easy and scalable way for:

1. Loading weather dataset from Cloud Storage into [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) and 
   [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)
2. Fast [interpolation & grid conversions](https://metview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gen_files/icon_functions/regrid.html)
   on large weather datasets

It supports popular multi-dimensional data formats including NetCDF, GRIB, and GeoTIFF.

## Why do we need this?

* **Upload Speed**: Files in a weather dataset will be processed in parallel.
  With [Dataflow autoscaling](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/horizontal-autoscaling), 
  even large datasets can be transferred to analytical engines in a
  reasonable amount of time.
* **Rapid Querying**: After your geospatial data is in BigQuery, data wrangling
  becomes as simple as writing SQL. This
  allows for rapid data exploration, visualization, and model pipeline
  prototyping.
* **Simple Versioning**: All rows in the destination BigQuery table come with
  a `data_import_time`
  column. This provides some notion of how
  the data is versioned. Downstream analysis can adapt to data ingested at
  different times by updating a `WHERE` clause.
* **Streaming Support**: Weather Mover supports a streaming mode where it
  automatically processes files as they appear in cloud buckets via PubSub.
* **Scalable Regridding**: The regrid option
  uses [MetView](https://metview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to
  interpolate Grib files to a
  [range of grids.](https://metview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metview/using_metview/regrid_intro.html?highlight=grid#grid)
  To learn more about its use cases,
  visit [MetView docs](https://metview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metview/using_metview/regrid_intro.html#regrid-explained).
* **Earth Engine**: By ingesting weather data into [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/),
  research teams can use its powerful [APIs and App Development interface](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine)
  for visualization and analysis of geospatial data.

> like `<level>_<height>_<attrs['GRIB_stepType']>_<key>`.
>
> This solves the issue of skipping over some of the data due
> to: https://github.com/ecmwf/cfgrib#filter-heterogeneous-grib-files.

_Example:_

```bash
weather-mv bigquery --uris "gs://your-bucket/*.nc" \
           --output_table $PROJECT.$DATASET_ID.$TABLE_ID \

Invoke with `rg -h` or `regrid --help` to see the full range of options.

> **Warning**: MetView requires a decent amount of disk space in order to
> perform any regrid operation! Intermediary
> regridding steps will write temporary grib data to disk. Thus, please make use
> of the `--disk_size_gb` Dataflow
> option. A good rule of thumb would be to consume `30 + 2.5x` GBs of disk,
> where `x` is the size of each source data
> file.
>
> TODO([#191](https://github.com/google/weather-tools/issues/191)): Find smaller
> disk space bound.

_Example_:

```bash
weather-mv regrid --uris "gs://your-bucket/*.gb" \

## Configuring Dataflow

One of the most powerful features of Apache Beam is supporting a wide range of
execution backends, called [_runners_](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/).
The default [_Direct Runner_](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/)
 is a multi-threaded single-node backend which executes the pipeline in the local 
machine. In contrast, the [_Dataflow Runner_](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/dataflow/)
deploys the pipeline on [Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow), 
a fully-managed Google Cloud service which is highly optimized for Apache Beam
pipelines. 

Using Dataflow has many benefits including convenient high-performance
integration with Cloud Storage and BigQuery as well as easy scaling.
The runner used for Weather Tools pipelines can be configured using
the `--runner` option (e.g. `--runner DataflowRunner`).
Additional configurations may also be passed to customize the Dataflow
pipeline including resources and autoscaling settings.

For a full reference of how to configure the Dataflow pipeline, please review
[this table](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/pipeline-options).

## Streaming ingestion

`weather-mv` optionally provides the ability to react
to [Pub/Sub events for objects added to GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications).
This can be used to automate ingestion into BigQuery as soon as weather data is
disseminated. Another common use case it to automatically create a down-sampled
version of a dataset with `regrid`. To set up the Weather Mover with streaming
ingestion, use the `--topic` flag (see [General Flags](#general-flags)).

Objects that don't match the `--uris` glob pattern will be filtered out of
ingestion. This way, a bucket can contain
multiple types of data yet only have subsets processed with `weather-mv`.

> **NOTE:** When setting up PubSub, make sure to create a topic for
**GCS `OBJECT_FINALIZE` events only**.

> **NOTE:** Data is written into BigQuery using streaming inserts. It may
> take [up to 90 minutes](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery#dataavailability)
> for buffers to persist into storage. However, weather data will be available for
> querying immediately.

> **NOTE:** It's recommended that you specify variables to
> ingest (`-v, --variables`) instead of inferring the schema for
> streaming pipelines. Not all variables will be distributed with every file,
> especially when they are in Grib format.

_Examples_:

```shell
weather-mv bq --uris "gs://your-bucket/*.nc" \
           --output_table $PROJECT.$DATASET_ID.$TABLE_ID \
           --topic "projects/$PROJECT/topics/$TOPIC_ID" \
           --runner DataflowRunner \
           --project $PROJECT \
           --temp_location gs://$BUCKET/tmp \
           --job_name $JOB_NAME 
```

Window incoming data every five minutes instead of every minute.

```shell
weather-mv bq --uris "gs://your-bucket/*.nc" \
           --output_table $PROJECT.$DATASET_ID.$TABLE_ID \
           --topic "projects/$PROJECT/topics/$TOPIC_ID" \
           --window_size 5 \
           --runner DataflowRunner \
           --project $PROJECT \
           --temp_location gs://$BUCKET/tmp \
           --job_name $JOB_NAME 
```

Increase the number of shards per window.

```shell
weather-mv bq --uris "gs://your-bucket/*.nc" \
           --output_table $PROJECT.$DATASET_ID.$TABLE_ID \
           --topic "projects/$PROJECT/topics/$TOPIC_ID" \
           --num_shards 10 \
           --runner DataflowRunner \
           --project $PROJECT \
           --temp_location gs://$BUCKET/tmp \
           --job_name $JOB_NAME 
```

## Known Issues

### "Quotas were exceeded: IN_USE_ADDRESSES"

This error occurs when GCP is trying to add new worker-instances and finds that,
“Public IP” quota (assigned to your project) is exhausted.

To solve this, we recommend using private IP while running your dataflow
pipelines.

```shell
weather-mv bq --uris "gs://your-bucket/*.nc" \
           --output_table $PROJECT.$DATASET_ID.$TABLE_ID \
           --temp_location gs://$BUCKET/tmp \
           --runner DataflowRunner \
           --project $PROJECT \
           --region $REGION \
           --no_use_public_ips \
           --network=$NETWORK \
           --subnetwork=regions/$REGION/subnetworks/$SUBNETWORK
```

_Network configuration options_:

* `--no_use_public_ips`: To make Dataflow workers use private IP addresses for
  all communication, specify the
  command-line flag: --no_use_public_ips. Make sure that the specified network
  or subnetwork has Private Google Access
  enabled.
* `--network`: The Compute Engine network for launching Compute Engine instances
  to run your pipeline.
* `--subnetwork`:  The Compute Engine subnetwork for launching Compute Engine
  instances to run your pipeline.

For more information regarding Dataflow pipeline options, see the [Configuring Dataflow](#configuring-dataflow)
section above.

## Dataflow Container Image

Weather Mover uses 3rd-party binary dependencies including MetView which can
not be reliably set up using pure python solutions. To overcome this, we use
the [Conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) distribution of these binaries.
While our [Conda environment](https://github.com/google/weather-tools/blob/main/environment.yml)
is sufficient for local runs, in remote executions like Dataflow, a Docker 
container image with the dependencies pre-installed is required.

By default, our public Docker image 
`gcr.io/weather-tools-prod/weather-tools:x.y.z` is used when the pipeline is 
executed using _DataflowRunner_. The image is built from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/google/weather-tools/blob/main/Dockerfile)
and produces the same Conda environment.

For development purposes, you may use your own customized Docker image. See
[these instructions](../Runtime-Container.md) to learn how to build a custom
image for this project using [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build).
After building and pushing the custom container image to a container registry of
your choice (like [Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)),
you can then specify the image used by Dataflow workers for running your 
pipeline using these flags:

 ```
 --experiment=use_runner_v2 \
 --sdk_container_image=$CONTAINER_URL
 ```

_Example:_

 ```bash
 weather-mv rg --uris "gs://your-bucket/*.nc" \
            --output_path "gs://regrid-bucket/" \
            --runner DataflowRunner \
            --project $PROJECT \
            --region  $REGION \
            --temp_location "gs://$BUCKET/tmp" \
            --experiment=use_runner_v2 \
            --sdk_container_image="gcr.io/$PROJECT/$REPO:latest"
            --job_name $JOB_NAME 
 ```

> **NOTE:** Currently, this image is only necessary for the `weather-mv regrid`
> command as the other commands use pure python dependencies.
